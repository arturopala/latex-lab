  \item Recent projects are confidential. Here's an older six-month project (adding an ARM front-end to our x86):
    \begin{list3}
    \item Helped reverse engineer the ARMv7 ISA (this was pre-AArch64, and we didn't have an ARM license)
    \item Created architectural simulator and got Android running on it\hfill \emph{C}
    \item Implemented \nicefrac{1}{2} of the translator, and wrote associated microcode \hfill \emph{Internal templating language}
    \item Created test generator that found 90\% of the first 1000 bugs on the project \hfill \emph{F\#}
    \item Result was a circa 2010 ARMv7 processor with better performance than any current ARM processor
    \end{list3}
  \item Other roles included formal verification, adding fault tolerance to a distributed system, post-silicon debug, test tooling, etc.
    
    
    %	\begin{list2}
    %% I often worked on new and experimental projects, which means that I was exposed to everything under the sun, but I can't talk about anything too recent.

    %% A few projects ago, we were experimenting with adding a front-end for another instruction set to our processor. Over the course of six months, I helped reverse engineer the ISA, created the architectural simulator, picked apart Linux (Android) to make it work in the simulator, wrote RTL for about half of the translator, along with microcode for the microcoded instructions, and created the test generator that found the first 1000 bugs on the project. 

    %% I was there for seven years, so there's no way to succinctly describe my responsibilities. I did everything from automated theorem proving for formal verification, to adding fault tolerance to a distributed system, to post-silicon lab debug.
    %%            I do a bit of everything, which makes a traditional bulleted list intractably long. To give an idea of the breadth of tasks I'm used to, in my last project, I converted QEMU to a simulator used for verifying correctness and taking performance traces, wrote the test generator that was used to file the first 500 bugs on the project, implemented the SIMD and other data processing instructions in the translator, determined what should be implemented in new hardware vs. existing uops vs. microcode, and then directed the hardware implementation for new hardware, and implemented the translator and wrote the microcode for cases where new hardware wasn't needed. I was also involved in directing verification and characterization. Experience on previous projects includes the following:
    %% %		\item Working on dynamic translation based instruction level and system simulator \hfill \emph{QEMU and C}
    %% %		\item Working on service / management processor (and assembler) \hfill \emph{Verilog and C++}
    %% 		\item Wrote microcode tools: code generator, test generator, etc. \hfill \emph{F\# (FParsec)}
    %% 		\item Created JTAG / probe mode debugger (FPGA with USB connection) \hfill \emph{Verilog}
    %% 		\item Worked on formal verification (mechanized theorem proving) \hfill \emph{ACL2 and Common Lisp}
    %% 		\item Optimized compiled cycle-based simulator; 12x faster than Synopsis VCS on RTL \hfill \emph{C++ and x86 assembly}
    %% 		\item Added fault tolerance to distributed computing system, increasing average uptime by 10x \hfill \emph{Ruby}
    %% 		\item Owned SYSENTER, SYSEXIT, SYSCALL, and SYSRET instructions on VIA Nano 3000 \hfill \emph{microcode}
    %% 		\item Increased throughput of distributed computing system by 50\% via statistical optimization \hfill \emph{R and Ruby}
    %% 		\item Created self-checking post-silicon pseudo-random test generator \hfill \emph{ACL2 and x86 assembly}
    %% 		\item Implemented SHA and AES in instruction-level simulator for new $\mu$architecture \hfill \emph{C++}
    %% 		\item Wrote full-chip pre-silicon test generators; filed 1700 of 6500 bugs on VIA Nano \hfill \emph{x86 assembly and Ruby}
    %% 		\item Ported parts of system model from Intel-compatible P4 bus to Via V4 bus \hfill \emph{Verilog}
    %% 		\item Post-silicon bring-up, debug, and speedpath testing for VIA Nano and Nano 3000
    %% 		\item Drove migration from perl (5.6) to Ruby in 2005
